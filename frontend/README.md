# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

## Manual Testing Instructions for Authentication Flows

### Registration
- Navigate to the registration page.
- Enter valid username, email, and password (minimum 6 characters).
- Submit the form and verify successful registration message.
- Try submitting with missing or invalid fields and verify validation errors.

### Login
- Navigate to the login page.
- Enter valid email and password.
- Submit the form and verify successful login and token storage.
- Try invalid credentials and verify error messages.

### Token Refresh
- The app automatically refreshes tokens using refresh tokens stored in cookies.
- To test manually, simulate token expiration and verify the app requests a new access token.

### Logout
- Use the logout button or link.
- Verify the session is cleared and user is redirected to the login page.

### Browsers and Devices
- Test the above flows on all major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
- Test on desktop and mobile devices to ensure responsiveness and functionality.

## Automated Testing
- Automated tests for registration and login flows are located in `frontend/src/__tests__/auth.test.js`.
- Run tests using `npm test` or `yarn test` in the frontend directory.
- These tests cover form validation, successful submissions, and error handling.
